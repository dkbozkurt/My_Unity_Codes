What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are solution methods for certain types of problems (Basically, repeated solutions).
	
Design patterns has 3 main categories:

* Creational Patterns are structures that manage the creation of the object. 
(Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype)

* Structural Patterns are architectures that manage structures between objects. 
(Adapter, Bridge, Filter, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy)

* Behavioral Patterns, structures that affect and govern the behavior of objects. 
(Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Memento, Observer, Null Object, Strategy, State, Visitor)
